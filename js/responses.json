I would put notes in her locker, but she would never talk to me. Then I moved away. Years later in high school I was visiting old Jr high friends and went to a party and there was a group of people surrounding this pretty girl who was talking animatedly. It was her! She had finally blossomed into a vivacious young woman! She saw me and called my name! But now it was my turn to be super shy and I just mumbled something and then avoided her for the rest of the party. Ever since then I've been wondering how she was, but she completely dropped off the map and no one knew where she was. Where did she go? What kind of person did she grow up into?"

I ended up needing his help with a rogue homeless man who was harassing my apartment building at the time. We ended up dating and moved in together after 4 months. We are still together to this day 3 and a half years later."

Nothing came much of that because I was scared to be in my first wlw relationship but she now also goes to UCSC!

I’m not in love with him anymore, my heart doesn’t drop when I hear his name but it still makes me sad that I’ll never speak to him again the way we used to talk. Though I’m not in love anymore I still think about him mostly everyday. There was no closure I’m still not sure why he left me if the day before he told me he’d love me forever and just for him to be hugging another girl and taking her to prom a week later broke my heart. I wonder if he still thinks of me and if he ever regrets what he did or even if he still loves me the way I do even if he’s not in love with me anymore I would like to still know what he feels towards me. I love him he has a special place in my heart. Like that one song says “I guess I’ll just miss her, even if she isn’t even really gone.”"

It made me not the person they fell in love with :( And I get that things ending are a sign for me and part of my journey of finding self worth, but I am genuinely so heartbroken about them. It’s been so long, too… I still cry about them all the time. They were a wonderful partner and friend and I am so happy I had the time I had with them. Overall, I know it’s okay and it’s going to be okay for us individually. I just miss them and I know this grief will be a part of me for a long time... If I could talk to them one more time I would say this: “I love you, and that’s it. I’m sorry for complicating things endlessly, I hope someday I’ll see you around and we could catch up as friends. I promise I will let my love for you stay with me as a reminder to do better and be better for myself and for others. Thank you for everything.”"
