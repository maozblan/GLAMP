I would put notes in her locker, but she would never talk to me. Then I moved away. Years later in high school I was visiting old Jr high friends and went to a party and there was a group of people surrounding this pretty girl who was talking animatedly. It was her! She had finally blossomed into a vivacious young woman! She saw me and called my name! But now it was my turn to be super shy and I just mumbled something and then avoided her for the rest of the party. Ever since then I've been wondering how she was, but she completely dropped off the map and no one knew where she was. Where did she go? What kind of person did she grow up into?"

I was considering putting my number on a piece of paper and leaving it on his windshield, but luckily the universe had other plans. I ended up needing his help with a rogue homeless man who was harassing my apartment building at the time. We ended up dating and moved in together after 4 months. We are still together to this day 3 and a half years later."
